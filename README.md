Number Guessing Game (Java)
📌 Project Description

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java console-based application where the program generates a random number and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
The program provides feedback such as “Too High”, “Too Low”, or “Correct Guess”, and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

This project helps in understanding random number generation, loops, conditional statements, and input validation in Java.

🎯 Features

Random number generation using Random class

User-friendly console interaction

Feedback on each guess (Too High / Too Low)

Limited number of attempts

Handles invalid (non-numeric) input

Clean and simple game logic

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Random Class

Scanner (User Input)

Loops and Conditional Statements
